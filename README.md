# KmlFileSplitter
The Kml File Splitter can be used to split a large kml file to several smaller ones. For each "document" a seperate file in a folder is created. The folder is named accordingly to the kml folder the document resides in.

The program was created to split the big file of https://flightsim.to/file/6887/google-earth-kml-files-for-all-msfs-airports to smaller files, each file representing a country. This can be used with https://github.com/mracko/MSFS-Mobile-Companion-App to show the airports on the map.

## Usage
- Copy the .kml file which needs to be split into the same directory as split_kml_file.exe.
- Execute split_kml_file.exe and wait a couple of seconds.
- A new folder "result" is created which contains the newly generated files.
